## User Experience

For the purpose of this project I have created a list of fitting user and admin stories to serve as a design guide in creating this webpage. *The Fitness Den* is a store selling fitness products and, as such, I based it on the Code Institute project of *Boutique Ado* given the similar theme. I've come up with the following user and admin stories thus far:

### Admin Stories

* As a **site admin** I can **add a product** so that **I can increase the stocks in my store**.
* As a **site admin** I can **edit and update existing products** so that **I can make real time changes to my stocks**.
* As a **site admin** I can **delete a product** so that **I can remove an existing item from the listings**.
* As a **site admin** I can **have a footer section with important details** so that **my clients can contact me, find out more about the store and its mission and sign up to a newsletter**.

### User Stories - Navigation

* As a **site user** I can **view a list of products** so that **I can purchase items**.

* As a **site user** I can **leave reviews on products** so that **I can let the merchant know my feedback**.

### User Stories - Purchases

* As a **site user** I can **view the items I currently have in my bag** so that **I can identify the total cost of my purchase as well as the items I will receive**.
* As a **site user** I can **adjust the quantity of items in my shopping bag** so that **I can make changes to my purchase before checkout**.
* As a **site user** I can **enter my payment information** so that **checkout quickly**.
* As a **site user** I can **be certain that my personal and payment information are safe** so that **I can confidently provide sensitive information to make a purchase**.
* As a **site user** I can **view an order after I checkout** so that **I can verify I haven't made any mistakes**.
* As a **site user** I can **receive an e-mail confirmation after I checkout** so that **I can be sure my payment went through and so I can keep a record**.

I followed the *Agile Methodology* when developing user stories and all of them are available on a separate Project board as well.

## Design and Business Model

### Design

The webpage was designed with the concept of an online fitness store in mind, hence I decided to call it *"The Fitness Den"* in order to call upon the imagery of heavy weights, good health and a 'den' much like a lion's den. The website is meant to allow the users to purchase a wide range of fitness items, from whey protein to calisthenics parallettes. The chosen artistic direction is meant to be clean, organized and easily navigable. The content of the webpage is neatly divided between collapsible buttons in the case of mobile view and interactive buttons in the case of widescreen view.

### Colour and Fonts

![Image of My Coolors Sample](media/CoolorsSample.png)

Colour tones associated with college and sports were chosen as basis for the colour palette of the webpage. As such, the main colours are the contrasts of berkeley blue and plain white. The complimentary colours chosen were slate grey for tertiary text, plain black for buttons, harvest gold for star rating functionality and an almost turqouise highlight for mouse hover on certain items and key words. My intent behind the design was to call upon a fitting color theme which will make the client think of college, dynamic sports and even a positive play on a stereotype - to a degree - of the high school "jock" so often shown in American movies and other media. This visual style is a nostalgic callback not just to hit pieces like "High School Musical" but also a clear and deliberate attempt at targeting one of the most vital demographics in the fitness industry - the young adults. I made use of modern UI/UX design solutions in order to provide a visually pleasing, clear, accessible and usable webpage.

For the heading, navbar, slogan and all the major secondary fonts I chose *"Graduate"* because it's very clean and creates a very deliberate high school/college image.
For complimentary text I chose *"Teko"* because it is pleasing to the eye, soft and rounded while still keeping a suitable visual 'edge'.
*Arial*, *Helvetica* and *Sans-Serif* were chosen as the emergency backup fonts in case the selected ones refuse to load because they're basic fonts that should display without any issues on all devices and software.

### Facebook 'Fitness Den' Mock-Up

![Image of My Facebook Business Mock-Up Page](media/FacebookMockup.png)

### Business Model, Marketing and Search Engines

*The Fitness Den* will follow a *product selling* business model in line with the **B2C** (*Business-to-Consumer*) philosophy, where the company and consumer will engage in commercial activity. The exact type of B2C that my fictional store will follow is **E-Commerce**, its biggest sector, encompassing all sorts of online stores, including my one.

The *marketing options* I have settled on are a mock-up of a **fictional Facebook business page** and the option to sign into a **monthly newsletter** ran by MailChimp. Moreover, I have also included **dummy social media links** in my footer, as well as my personal and real social media links.

I followed the Code Institute tutorial on *Search Engine Optimization* and created **robots.txt** and **sitemap.xml** files. Additionally I included two small **information boxes** in the footer which included **keywords** which have a chance to be picked up by any search engine of choice, while not being flagged as spam and filler.

### Marketing Types Challenge - Questions and Answers

1. Who are your users?
    * Fitness enthusiasts, health freaks, aspiring calisthenics gymnasts and bodybuilding fanatics.
2. Which online platforms would you find lots of your users?
    * YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, online forums dedicated to fitness and personal wellbeing, 4chan, possibly Facebook as well.
3. Would your users use social media? If yes, which platforms do you think you would find them on?
    * Most definitely. Fitness gets a lot of traction on the social media I mentioned in the previous point. The introduction of 'Shorts' has been giving the fitness community a huge boost as well in recent years.
4. What do your users need? Could you meet that need with useful content? If yes, how could you best deliver that content to them?
    * My site users and customers would certainly need smooth website navigation, easy checkouts, a wide range of products, secure transactions and competitive prices. I'm confident I could deliver that content by having a clean UI, a fast website and a selection of the most popular products at fair prices.
5. Would your business run sales or offer discounts? How do you think your users would most like to hear about these offers?
    * It would, yes. I imagine my users would most like to hear about these offers by subscribing to a monthly newsletter so they're always kept up to date through their e-mails. Alternatively a social media presence - such as the Facebook mock-up - could work really well for shop stock updates.
6. What are the goals of your business? Which marketing strategies would offer the best ways to meet those goals?
    * We aim to revolutionize the digital fitness e-commerce sector. The best marketing strategies to meet those goals would be a significant and active social media presence, a clean and well functioning website, as well frequent discounts, deals and other offers.
7. Would your business have a budget to spend on advertising? Or would it need to work with free or low cost options to market itself?
    * It depends on how big it became. Initially it would be free, 'homemade' advertising or low cost options. Nowadays we live in an era where you can make it big if you're smart about how you use social media and observe the current trends. YouTube, TikTok and Instagram shorts have really changed the game in recent months.

### Structure

The website is structured in a user friendly way that makes navigation of its contents extremely easy and makes it pleasing to the eye. The *Home Page* serves as the central hub of the design, allowing for quick access to other sections of the project through fully interactive buttons. Overall the project is made up of many pages, including but not limited to:
* **The Home Page**, with its selection of navigational buttons and a collapsible menu for mobile users, as well as its highly informational footer.
* **The Products Page**, with its long list of available products separated by categories as well as an individual product view with user reviews.
* **The Contact Page**, with its direct confidential message to admin functionality.
* **The Shopping Bag Page**, with its easy-to-use shopping bag functionality of adding, adjusting and removing items from the shopping bag.
* **The Checkout Page**, with the ability to use existing delivery information and finalize any transaction.
* **The Wishlist Page**, where the user can save products for later purchase.
* **Profile Page**, with its ability to securely save personal information and access client's order history.
* **Log In and Log Out Pages**, which allow the clients to register on the page, log in and retrieve their account if password is lost.

*...and many more.*

### Django

This project uses *Django* with *Code Institute's CI Full Template* and requires a set of commands to work properly.

1. In your GitPod workspace type: `pip3 install django`
2. To make sure everything is working as intended run the following command: `python3 manage.py runserver`
3. Run the initial migration with the following command: `python3 manage.py migrate`
4. In order to access the admin panel you have to create a superuser by using the following command: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` after which you fill out the necessary details.
5. Once everything is set up properly you can run the initial commit and push to GitHub.

### Heroku

This project was deployed on Heroku.

After the repository is forked, you can deploy it by following these steps:

1. Create an account on Heroku or log into your existing one
2. Go to the *Dashboard*
3. Create a new app, add its name and your geographical region
4. Click on *Create App*
5. Go to your *Settings* tab
6. Under *Config Vars* make sure you have set the following:
    * *USE_AWS* with its value of *True*
    * *AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID* with its custom value
    * *AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY* with its custom value
    * *DATABASE_URL* with its custom value
    * *SECRET_KEY* with its custom value
    * *STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY* with its custom value
    * *STRIPE_SECRET_KEY* with its custom value
    * *STRIPE_WH_SECRET* with its custom value
    * *HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_CRIMSON_URL* with its custom value
7. Go to your *Resources* tab and make sure you have *Heroku Postgres* either as a hobby dev or the paid options.
8. In your GitPod install the database url with the following command: `pip3 install dj_database_url`
9. Then, once that is installed, proceed to install the psycopg binary with the following command: `pip3 install psycopg2-binary`
10. Make sure you install and load all app requirements in GitPod with the following command: `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
11. In *settings.py* import dj_database_url at the top of the file and parse the temporary database settings.
12. Run migrations and create superuser for Heroku.
13. Remove the temporary database you set up previously and create an if statement in *settings.py* to run the postgres on Heroku.
14. Install the package called gunicorn with the following command: `pip3 install gunicorn`
15. Alternatively, if the package doesn't load properly, you can install Heroku functionality directly with the following command: `npm install -g heroku`
16. Create a Procfile and input the following content: `web: gunicorn fitness_den.wsgi:application`
17. In the *Config Vars* in Heroku temporarily input *DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC* with the value of 1 to stop Heroku from collecting static files during initial deployment.
18. Add Heroku to your *ALLOWED_HOSTS* section in *settings.py*. Make sure to enable localhost as well.
19. Deploy directly to Heroku with the following command: `git push heroku main`
20. If you want Heroku to keep automatically updating the project you can set *'enable automatic deploys'* under the *'deployment method'* option.

### Amazon AWS S3

1. Open your browser and navigate to Amazon AWS.
2. Log in to an existing account or create a new one.
3. Create a new S3 bucket as well as "media" and "static" directories within the bucket itself.
4. Copy the details of your newly made bucket from the dashboard. You will need the following:
    * Storage Bucket Name
    * Storage Bucket Region Name
    * Access Key ID
    * Secret Access Key
5. You must then add the following settings to the env.py file to link directly to AWS:
    * os.environ["AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"] = `'your access key'`
    * os.environ["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"] = `'your secret access key'`
6. Once that's done, you can go back to Heroku and add the keys and values from AWS and env.py to the config vars

### Stripe

1. Open your browser and navigate to Stripe.com.
2. Create a Stripe account or log into an existing one.
3. Ensure you click *"Developer Account"* to gain access to the API keys required to run the payment processes.
4. Once you have successfully created your Stripe account make sure you do the following:
    * Copy the Stripe Public Key, Stripe Secret Key and Stripe Webhook Key into your env.py file and into the Heroku Config Vars section.
5. Then, configure the *settings.py* file with the following variables required by Stripe:
    * `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = os.environ.get('STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY')`
    * `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')`
    * `STRIPE_WH_SECRET = os.getenv('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '')`
